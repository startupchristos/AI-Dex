# Dex Launcher - Resilient wrapper for background launch agents
#
# Instead of hardcoding vault paths in plists, agents call this wrapper
# which resolves the vault path at runtime and validates it exists.
#
# Usage (in plist ProgramArguments):
#   dex-launcher.sh <script-relative-path> [args...]
#
# Example:
#   dex-launcher.sh .scripts/meeting-intel/sync-from-granola-v2.cjs
#
# Path resolution (in order):
#   1. ~/.config/dex/vault-path (written at install time)
#   2. Derive from this script's own location (fallback)
